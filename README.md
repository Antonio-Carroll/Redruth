# Redruth Reading Room Project

> This website is for recording audio that will be added to a repository of stories documenting the history of the town of Redruth and it's residents. We want any story big or small. These stories will be exhibited as part of a library in Redruth Reading Room, a small space in the old Library building which we will install and respond to the stories of the town. 


The Redruth Reading Room Project is an oral history project meant to refill the center with stories. Any data
you provide will only be used to add additional context to your audio recording, and contact information will
only be used by project adminstrators for requests to participate in future projects.
